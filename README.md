# AI for Chest X-Ray

This is a Machine Learning Model to diagnosing Chest X-Ray

### Industry :
Healthcare

### Project Title :
Azure AI for Medical Imaging

### Problem Statement/Opportunity :
 AI to try to help diagnose lung diseases, such as viral pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia.

### Project Description :
The content covers Azure Machine learning, Azure Cognitive service, and custom vision. Cognitive services provide machine learning capabilities. You don’t need special machine learning or data science knowledge to use these services. And I’ll share with you how to implement an image classifier for chest X-ray diagnosis with Azure AI. Azure Machine learning is very helpful for Data Science applications.
Now I will introduce how to build an image classifier for detecting viral pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia with Azure AI.
#### A. Why Needs Detect Viral Pneumonia, and Bacterial Pneumonia With AI?
The world has changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Medical staff around the world have shown bravery and resilience in the fight against COVID-19, and some even sacrificed their lives while performing their duties. As an ordinary person, as a programmer, I also want to help. Therefore, using AI to try to help diagnose lung diseases, such as viral pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia.
#### B. Azure Cognitive Servies
Azure is a cloud computing platform, it also provides AI services for developers. <a class="af nh" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Azure Cognitive Services</a> is a comprehensive family of AI services and cognitive APIs to help you build intelligent apps.

Azure Cognitive Services contains many different types of AI services, such as Decision services, Language services, Speech services, Vision services, and Web search services.

What we need is an AI Vision service. By using Custom Vision services, we can identify and analyze attributes within images, videos, and digital ink. In order to train our own model, we can select the Custom Vision service of Vision services to customize image recognition to fit our needs.

### Create A Custom Vision Project and Get The Dataset :
The Custom Vision service provided by Azure provides us a user-friendly interface to develop and deploy custom computer vision models. In the following image, You can find the process of creating custom computer vision models that fit with our use case.

So, let’s create our Custom Vision Project and get a suitable dataset online.
